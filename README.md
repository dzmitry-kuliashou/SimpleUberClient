# SimpleUberClient
Client using SimpleUberWebApi service
It's very simple web application - only one page, no web-design.
I cannot say, that I'm good front-end developer, as mostly I work with back-end code. So, this project had two main goals:
1. Try MVC+TypeScript+React technology
2. Create real client for WebApi services, which you can find in SimpleUberWebApi project - https://github.com/dzmitry-kuliashou/SimpleUberWebApi

Although this is very small project, I think, it has numerous of agile solutions, which alow to scale it to big real web-application. For example you can find common classes for creating requsts to Rest WebApi services and handling service's responses, including common and validation errors.
Using of TypeScript+React allows to create agile and re-useable web-components. And although this project has only small amount of React component, it uses the bigger part of React technology functionality.
